                <p>A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of
                    intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of
                    coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a
                    possible increased risk in pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were
                    complicated by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size

            <h1 id="t">TYPES</h1>
            <p>Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a
                genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs
                to trees.</p>

                    <li>
                        <dt><b>Types of bean.</b> There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta.
                            Arabica originates from Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the
                            most popular type worldwide. However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is
                            sensitive to the environment, requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between
                            60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is
                            resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65-97 degrees
                            Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in rainfall and
                            strong sunlight.</dt>

                        <dt><b>Types of roast.</b> Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to
                            produce a chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor that we associate with
                            coffee. They are then cooled and ground for brewing Roasting levels range from light to
                            medium to dark. The lighter the roast, the lighter the color and roasted flavor and the
                            higher its acidity, Dark roasts produce a black bean with little acidity and a bitter
                            roasted flavor. The popular French roast is medium dark.</dt>

                    <li>
                        <dt><b>Types of grind.</b> A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee
                            makers. A fine grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso which releases the oils, and a
                            coarse grind is used in coffee presses.</dt>

                    <li>
                        <dt><b>Decaffeinated coffee.</b> This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side
                            effects from caffeine. The two most common methods used to remove caffeine from coffee is to
                            apply chemical solvents (methylene chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon dioxide gas. Both
                            are applied to steamed or soaked beans, which are then allowed to dry. The solvents bind to
                            caffeine and both evaporate when the beans are rinsed and/or dried. According to US
                            regulations, at least 97% of the caffeine must be removed to carry the decaffeinated label,
                            so there may be trace residual amounts of caffeine. Both methods may cause some loss of
                            flavor as other naturally occurring chemicals in coffee beans that impart their unique
                            flavor and scent may be destroyed during processing.</dt>

                    are dark roasted, meaning, they taste bitter. And many consumers, who know their coffee, complain
